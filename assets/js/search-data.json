            "content": "Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code .

          "content": "My name is Jun Hong, but please call me Nemo. I am a data scientist with an interest in health data science. I graduated with a BA Philosophy focusing on Set Theory and Logic. Taking up Formal Syntax and Formal Semantics as an undergraduate led me to taking a MSc in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Even though I graduated with a Merit, I felt very lost as I felt I was only learning techniques without any good reason; sure, there was improving accuracy and other metrics for, say, machine translation, I was never motivated by seeing some numbers increase. I also didn’t have the proper requisites in either Mathematical Science or Linguistics, so I had trouble putting the pieces together. . This led to a period of confusion for about 2 years as I took up some jobs. 2 jobs helped define my interests. First, I created 2 simple games for the Singapore General Hospital using proprietary software from SeriousGames Asia. This led to me getting comfortable working alongside experts (nurses) as they gave me feedback on how to improve the games I made1. . Given my experience in healthcare and my experience in writing as an undergraduate, I decided to try my hand at content writing for a medical media company. This job had me researching, writing, and editing articles optimised for SEO for doctors. However, having had 2 years to meander through life, I couldn’t shake my desire to return to Mathematics. After leaving the company, I decided to read up on data science and statistics to see how NLP related to those 2 fields. Gradually, I realised data science and statistics were the fields I had more interest in compared to Artificial Intelligence (AI), which was more computer science oriented. . I signed up for a 12 week data science bootcamp with General Assembly in Singapore, where I live. I’m aiming to go to healthcare, working in biostatistics and data science as applied to epidemiology and medicine! . This website is powered by fastpages 2. . For those interested, the first game I made was a catheterisation game to help nurses remember the steps to inserting a catheter into a female patient. The second game was a game to help don and doff (take off) a CLD500 hazmat suit. &#8617; . | a blogging platform that natively supports Jupyter notebooks in addition to other formats. &#8617; . |",
